### Taistelun hurmos

[Taistelun hurmos] is a mighty 2D game written in Go and it
uses Ebiten library for the game engine + sqlite for databases.

The goal of this project is to create a huge succesful game that will hit #1 on Steam.

On the side I will learn Go and to get more familiar with databases.
Hopefully after all the time spent on the 2D graphics you can call me a MS Paint Picasso.

This project is purely for my own enjoyment and a great way for me to see how fast will I get a grip of a totally new language.
